        <h1>About Luka Vasil</h1>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/27M3CY8/image.png" alt="Picture of me">
        <p>My name is Luka Vasil. I am a student at Emerald High School in Dublin, California and I'm interested in becoming a software developer. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and sports, and my goal in life is to become a software developer who creates innovative sports-related apps. I'm passionate about using my coding skills to enhance the experience for athletes or to build apps for sports games. By focusing on sports apps, I want to bring better technology to the sports industry, improving performance and overall enjoyment of the games. I hope to create apps that are not only functional but also fun to use. Overall, I want to make a significant impact in the world of sports through the power of software development.</p>
        <p> </p> 
        <p>I am a hardworking and flexible person who values teamwork and creativity. One of my biggest challenges came when I was cut from my previous baseball team a year ago. Instead of giving up, I focused on practicing every week to improve. This paid off when I made the Emerald High School Baseball Team this year. Working with my teammates helped me understand the importance of cooperation and encouraged me to think creatively about how to improve our game together.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I am also a member of the Golden Ratio Club, where we do 3D design and modeling. This has helped me become more reliable as a team member, especially when we work on projects together. I am also taking a difficult class this year, chemistry, which has pushed me to think critically and manage my time better. Focusing on school, sports, and clubs at the same time has been hard, but it has taught me the value of hard work and responsibility. Through these experiences, I have learned that being adaptable, cooperative, and creative are important qualities that will help me succeed in the future.</p> 
        <p> </p>
        <p>My journey through baseball, school, and other activities has shaped me into who I am today. The problems I've faced have taught me the importance of hard work, teamwork, and creative problem solving. As I continue to pursue my passion for sports, I want to use my interests in sports and technology by creating sports-related apps that can enhance the experience for athletes and fans alike. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I thank you for taking your time to look at my page, as I work toward my future in the sports tech industry.
